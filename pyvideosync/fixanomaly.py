def fix_discontinuities(arr: np.array) -> list:
    """Repairs incremental discontinuities in a 1-D integer array.

    The function identifies and fixes two specific anomaly types in an otherwise incrementally increasing integer array:

    - **Type I Discontinuity**: Single zero occurring between two integers that differ by exactly 2.
      Example: `[1, 2, 3, 0, 5]` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

    - **Type II Discontinuity**: Sequence reset starting from zero and incrementally counting up again from 1.
      Example: `[7, 8, 0, 1, 2]` becomes `[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`.

    Args:
        arr (list or np.ndarray): The input array containing integer values. It is expected
            to be primarily incremental but may contain anomalies as described above.

    Returns:
        list: A corrected array with discontinuities repaired, maintaining incremental continuity.

    Examples:
        >>> fix_discontinuities([1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 6, 7, 0, 9])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

        >>> fix_discontinuities([5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

        >>> fix_discontinuities([2, 0, 4, 0, 6])
        [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    Notes:
        - If the discontinuity cannot be resolved (e.g., zero at the very end with no following numbers),
          the function leaves the original value(s) unchanged.
        - The function makes a copy of the input array to avoid side-effects.
